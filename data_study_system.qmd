# Dingo (*Canis lupus dingo*) 

> Dingoes (Canis  lupus  dingo) most likely arrived in Australia on boats from Asia at least 4,000 years ago [1–3].
Sometime after their  introduction  and  adoption  by  indigenous  Australians, dingoes became feral and have since occupied nearly every terrestrial habitat on the mainland [4]. Dingoes, like free-roaming dogs elsewhere, interact with humans and the water and food resources they provide either purposely or accidentally though refuse and artificial water points [5].
