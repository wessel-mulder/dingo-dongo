Land-use in the study region includes gold mining operations and pastoral activities. Mining operations are located at The Granites and Dead Bullock Soak (DBS). Disused gold mines with open-cut pits and no human occupation are located at Windy Hill and Tanami Mine, and cattle are kept on Tanami Downs. At the time of this study, there were 13 human-provided watering points permanently available to dingoes (Figure 1). Also available to dingoes were large quantities of food scraps within refuse facilities at The Granites and to a lesser extent at DBS. A roadhouse is located at Rabbit Flat and a farm house is occupied by pastoral workers on Tanami Downs. A series of major and minor tracks associated with both pastoral and mining operations exists throughout the study region (Figure 1).\n\nFrom Newsome et al. (2013).\n\nMine sites\n\nFood resources for dingoes are spatially clumped and very rich\nCan lead to increased interactions with humans and possibly each other\n\n\n\nSpatially distant areas (non-mine sites)\n\nFood resources are naturally dispersed and relatively sparse"

    "text": "GPS data collection\n\n\n\nDingo GPS data collection area\n\n\n\nOne hundred and eleven dingoes were live captured and released between April 2008 and April 2010 and collars housing a GPS data logger and a VHF transmitter (Sirtrack, Havelock North, New Zealand and Bluesky Telemetry, Aberfeldy, Scotland) were fitted to a sample of 23 adults. Both male and female dingoes were collared, but only if they weighed more than 20 times the weight of the collar. Collar weight also limited the sampling period so, to ensure that dingoes were tracked under all seasonal conditions, collaring was staggered throughout the study period. In doing so, we sampled dingoes in as many areas as possible along a latitudinal transect between DBS and Mt Davidson (Figure 1) whilst ensuring replicates of both males and females in the sampled areas where GPS fixes (locations logged and stored as longitude- latitude co-ordinates) had been recovered from retrieved collars. The GPS unit on every collar was programmed to estimate a fix each hour, with sampling rates based on battery-life calculations. Seven collars suffered mechanical failures and did not return any data, and three were not found, but the remainder logged GPS information for up to 10 months at a time. Data from the collars included an Horizontal Dilution Of Position (HDOP) value as well as the number of satellites used to calculate each fix. The HDOP was used to determine a Maximum Allowable Error (MAE) of fix accuracy by multiplying the HDOP value by the accuracy of the GPS device, which was 2.5 m [24]. Fixes with an HDOP value &gt; 8 were excluded to balance the number of usable fixes against positional accuracy, yielding a MAE of 40 m.\n\nFrom Newsome et al. (2013)\n\n\n\nFrom Newsome et al.
